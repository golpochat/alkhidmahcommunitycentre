## 6. Partially Implemented or Hidden Today

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **About — Our Values & Committee** | CMS at `/admin/about`; toggle visibility per section |
| **Editor role gap** | Can manage lists but blocked from create/edit/upload without `content.write` |
| **Legacy config** | Display/TV components may still read some constants — migrate as needed |
| **Email verification on register** | Only used for email *change*, not new sign-ups |
| **Display PIN / scrolling ticker** | Stored or built but not enforced on TV UI |

---

## 7. Product Roadmap (3 phases)

> Phase 1 items below were implemented June 2026 unless marked otherwise.

### Phase 1 — Operational Essentials (Foundation) ✓

**Goal:** Fix gaps that block day-to-day mosque operations and reduce confusion for staff after deploy.

1. **Contact messages admin** — inbox to read, mark handled, export. ✓
2. **First-run publish checklist** — seed content unpublished by default. ✓
3. **Update FEATURES.md** — document TV Display, fee cover, cron job. ✓
4. **Technical housekeeping** — remove unused `storage.ts`; fix dead settings. ✓
5. **Align donation category seeding** — consistent `isActive` defaults. ✓
6. **Env/deployment doc consolidation** — one clear list of required env vars. ✓
7. **Publish Status Overview (NEW)** — dashboard showing published/unpublished items. ✓

**Outcome:** Staff can manage inbound contact, new deployments aren't blank, and documentation matches the product.

---

### Phase 2 — Member Experience & Staff Workflows ✓

**Goal:** Complete self-service for members and tighten admin notifications and content control.

1. **Member portal — My Donations** — email-linked + retroactive linking. ✓
2. **Member portal — My Registrations**. ✓
3. **About page CMS** — Dynamic Values + Committee. ✓
4. **Homepage Eid banner** — mount when Eid overrides active. ✓
5. **Admin donation notifications** — email staff on successful donations. ✓
6. **Donation category CRUD** — create/delete; prevent deletion if category has donations. ✓
7. **Unify site config** — single source for contact, branding, social links, PDFs. ✓
8. **Twitter/X in site settings** — wired into footer. ✓

**Outcome:** Members see their own history; staff get timely alerts; public site content is easier to manage.

---

### Phase 3 — Scale, Polish & Long-Term Growth ✓

**Goal:** Improve reach, automation, analytics, and reduce manual work.

1. **Content audit trail** — log publish/unpublish actions. ✓
2. **Scheduled publish** — auto-publish events/programmes. ✓
3. **Gallery item-level publish** — optional. ✓
4. **SEO expansion** — metadata/sitemap tuning. ✓
5. **Analytics dashboard** — donation trends, registration funnel, display usage. ✓
6. **PWA / offline prayer times** — home-screen install, cached widget. ✓
7. **Automated Ramadan Timetable (NEW)** — auto-generate timetable + daily Suhoor/Iftar auto-publish. ✓
8. **Display enhancements** — PIN lock, ticker, brightness scheduling. ✓

**Outcome:** Less manual work, better visibility into usage, and long-term scalability.

---

### Future updates (not in current phases)

Items kept for later — **not** part of Phase 1–3 implementation until explicitly prioritised.

| # | Item | Benefit | Effort / notes |
|---|------|---------|----------------|
| 6 | **EN / AR (multi-language)** | Reach Arabic-speaking community | Large, ongoing translations + RTL |
| 8 | **Volunteer / newsletter** | Organise helpers + bulk communication | New modules + GDPR/consent |

---

## 8. Things Easy to Miss (team notes)

- **Unpublished by default** — new events, programmes, albums, and categories do not appear on the public site until toggled on in admin
- **Donations vs Categories** — same sidebar item, two tabs; category “Published” = `isActive` in the database
- **Prayer Timetable** — sidebar label is “Prayer Timetable”; URL is still `/admin/special-prayers`
- **Contact Messages** — uses `registrations.manage` permission; route `/admin/contact`
- **About Page CMS** — `/admin/about` (requires `content.write`); toggles Values/Committee visibility
- **Member portal** — `/user/donations` and `/user/registrations` match by account email
- **Publish checklist** — admin dashboard shows unpublished content after seed/deploy
- **Database commands** — use `npm run db:push`, `npm run db:deploy`, `npm run db:migrate` (not raw `npx prisma`); env loads from `.env.local`
- **Ramadan QR** — uses published donation categories from the Categories tab
- **Flyer generator** — super admin only; uses active donation categories
- **Registrations** — public form only works for **published** programmes

---

## 9. Technical Debt / Housekeeping

- ~~Remove unused `src/lib/storage.ts` (legacy JSON helpers)~~ — removed
- ~~Remove unused `prayer_override_enabled` setting~~ — removed from defaults/seed
- Consolidate super-admin email settings (tab vs duplicate route)
- See [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) for the full environment variable list

---
